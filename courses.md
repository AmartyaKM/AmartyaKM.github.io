## STAT 201: General Statistics
- **Course Description:** Covered foundational topics including graphs, descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and correlation. Utilized JMP software for data analysis.

## STAT 301: Introduction to Applied Statistical Methods
- **Course Description:** Explored statistical science methods, focusing on probability, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, regression, and practical considerations in inference. Emphasized the use of software for analysis rather than hand calculation.

## STAT 341: Statistical Data Analysis I
- **Course Description:** Addressed estimation and inference based on Gaussian linear regression models, focusing on residual analysis, variable selection, and non-linear regression.

## STAT 342: Statistical Data Analysis II
- **Course Description:** Explored single-factor and multi-factor analysis of variance models, randomized block design, Latin squares, and split-plot design.

## STAA 551: Regression Models and Applications
- **Course Description:** Covered model estimation, goodness of fit for linear models, confidence intervals, lack of fit, model diagnostics, transformations, and influential observations. Emphasized implementation in SAS and R.

## STAA 554: Mixed Models
- **Course Description:** Explored topics in linear models with fixed and random predictors, including split-plot designs, mixed-effects factorials, repeated measures, and spatial models. Generalized linear and nonlinear mixed models were introduced, with practical implementation in SAS and R.

## STAR 511: Design and Data Analysis for Researchers I
- **Course Description:** Taught statistical methods for experimenters and researchers, emphasizing designing and analyzing experiments.

## STAR 512: Design and Data Analysis for Researchers II
- **Course Description:** Continued instruction in statistical methods for experimenters and researchers, focusing on advanced design and analysis of experiments.

These teaching experiences demonstrate my proficiency in conveying complex statistical concepts and fostering practical skills among students while integrating modern software tools for effective data analysis.
