My name is Amartya Kumar Maulik, and I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Colorado State University. I hold an M.S. in Statistics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and a B.S. in Statistics from the University of Calcutta, Kolkata, where I also completed minors in Mathematics and Computer Science. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Colorado State University, I have taught and graded for STAT 201 Statistics students. I also worked as a Data Analyst Intern for the Intelligent Customer Interactions Team at Ford Motors, where I addressed the classification problem of predicting the likelihood of buying various Ford Nameplates at customer level.
In addition to my academic and work experience, I have completed several projects and research work, such as MCMC in Mixture Models, Feature Selection and Comparison of classifiers, and Time Series Modelling of the Apple Stock Price. I have used various methods such as Collapsed Gibbs, Blocked Gibbs, Sliced Gibbs, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier, Random Forest classifier, Chi-Square Feature Selection, and Mutual Information Feature Selection in R and Python. My research work has allowed me to gain experience in data analysis, statistical modelling, and programming, and I am interested in pursuing a career in academia or industry, where I can continue to apply my skills and knowledge to solve real-world problems.
